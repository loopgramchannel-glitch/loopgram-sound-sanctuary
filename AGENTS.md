## Architecture rules
- Keep the four data flows separate (see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md): ordinary page reads must not touch DynamoDB or R2, so one failing service can't take down pages.
- All TMDB calls go through `tmdb()` in backend.server.ts, which handles the allowlist, caching, request merging and the refresh lock; never fetch TMDB directly.
- YouTube trailers must pass the `resolveVideos()` playability check before they're shown; LOOPGRAM never presents trailers as full movies.
- Paged lists use `useInfiniteList` (src/lib/infinite.ts) + `InfiniteFooter`; one engine keeps dedupe, end detection and retry consistent.
- Full-length playback comes only from the owner's R2 bucket via `findStream()` (playback.server.ts); never embed third-party piracy/"embed provider" sites — titles without an uploaded file fall back to the trailer.
- Search index writes go only through `handleSearchJob()` in algolia.server.ts (admin key, server-only); the browser queries Algolia with the search-only key. One job entry point lets a future SQS worker reuse it.
- Background work goes through `sendJob()`/`processBatch()` (sqs.server.ts) with a Redis done-marker per job key; producers fall back to running inline when the queue is unavailable. Server logs go through `log()` (log.server.ts), which scrubs secrets and ships to CloudWatch best-effort.
- Auth is Firebase email/password; the browser never decides roles. Every Studio server function calls `requireOwner()` (auth.server.ts: verifies the ID token via Google JWKS, owner = OWNER_UID or verified `role: owner` claim, account live, session not revoked). Admin calls use the Identity Toolkit REST API with the service account (no firebase-admin, it doesn't run on workerd).
- Studio audit entries are written only server-side via `audit()`; public site settings (banner, maintenance) live in Redis `site:settings` and maintenance never blocks /login or /studio.
- Constants used by both a route's options (validateSearch, loader) and its component live in `src/lib`, not the route file; the route code-splitter cannot share non-exported route-file constants.
- Studio uploads go browser → R2 via short-lived signed PUT links from `upload.functions.ts`; destination keys come only from `uploadKey()` (upload-keys.ts) so movie/episode files land where `findStream()` looks. Large files never pass through the worker.
- Owner posts live in Redis `site:posts`, read/written only via posts.functions.ts; TMDB master switch is `tmdbEnabled` in `site:settings`, enforced inside `tmdb()` so every caller obeys it.

- TMDB answers are saved permanently (no TTL) in DynamoDB `TMDB#<cacheKey>`/`RESPONSE` via catalog.server.ts; DynamoDB is read only as the last fallback after Redis so the site survives TMDB being off/revoked. Why: owner requires data to outlive TMDB access.
- Periodic work (TMDB import step + SQS drain) runs from `heartbeat()` (heartbeat.server.ts), started via `ctx.waitUntil` in src/server.ts and gated by Redis `lg:heartbeat` (≈1/min across instances). Why: no external scheduler; every step is idempotent so cut-off runs just retry.
- Owner posts are searchable only through the separate Algolia index `loopgram_posts`, written by `syncPost()`/`reconcilePosts()` from the DynamoDB post state (PUBLISHED only). Why: keeps the two content sources distinguishable and drafts out of search.

- Loop Party state goes only through party-store.server.ts: Redis first with TTLs, DynamoDB (PK PARTY#<code>, `exp` attribute filtered on read) when Redis is down or over quota; hot reads use a per-isolate memo and writes use per-IP local rate limits. Why: parties must keep working when one service hits a plan limit.
- Post views/likes go only through post-stats.server.ts: Redis hash ps:<id> is the live counter with per-viewer dedupe keys, DynamoDB POSTSTAT#<id> is the batched permanent total and read fallback. Why: viral posts must not cost one storage write per tap.
- Adaptive HLS for full movies/episodes (and Studio post videos via `post <url>`, played through `attachSource()` in hls-attach.ts with MP4 fallback) is made offline by scripts/transcode-hls.ts (ffmpeg ladder, never upscales) and uploaded to R2 at the findStream() paths; segments immutable, playlists short-cached, master uploaded last. Why: workers cannot run ffmpeg, and R2 edge caching serves chunks without origin load.
- New owner videos (posts, movies, episodes): studioUploadDone sends an SQS `transcode` job; scripts/sqs-transcode-worker.ts (ffmpeg, run anywhere, `--drain` in the 10-minute GitHub Actions cron) converts it via convertOne() in convert-posts.ts, whose full scan stays as the safety net. The web heartbeat hands transcode jobs straight back to the queue. Why: workers cannot run ffmpeg.
- Site settings (`site:settings`) are read/written only via settings-store.server.ts: dual-write Redis + DynamoDB `SETTINGS#SITE`/`DATA`, newest `_savedAt` wins on read, 15s per-isolate memo. Why: Studio saves and auto-pull switches must work when Redis is over quota.
